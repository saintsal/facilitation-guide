Weaving (principle)
When you're discussing a single topic, then the structure of your whole story is easy to follow for the participants. 
There's one beginning, a body, and a conclusion.
Things become harder to follow when multiple topics are treated in sequence. 
For example, by combining business models, and customer development in a session that lasts an afternoon. 

People tend to naturally understand the topics separately, but grasping the whole of the sequence is harder.
This is particularly the case if your program runs over multiple days.

Weaving is what you do to make people see the links. You're addressing their assumptions of how the topics fit together.
It's more than emphasizing the learning points, it's about showing how the points connect.
