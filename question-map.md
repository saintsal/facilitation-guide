1. Ask people to think of what they want to learn today/this week/over the programme.
1. Ask them to think about their current challenges and what they can apply, to make their requests actionable.
1. Ask them to write down one question or request per sticky note.
1. When they have a sticky note, ask them to come to front of the room and explain their request *to everyone.*

It's important that they share one at a time and to the room.
