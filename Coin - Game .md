# Coin - Game 

## Purpose
For everyone to experience why small batches are advantageous to larger batches in production.

## Background
Coin - game is a game which simulates / demonstrates 'Lean-Manufacturing Process' such as popularized by Toyota. 

After the WW II. , Toyata incorporated a new workflow / work style which meant that in terms of production it could compete with larger manufacturers.  

The thinking at the time was around Economies Of Scale - the more you make, the cheaper your unit costs, therefore the lower your prices and the higher your market share.

Toyota instead focused on the efficiency of working capital.  The more you've invested but not seen the benefit, the less efficient you are.  Galf-built product is of no value.  Lots of half-built product is of no value.  The faster you can build and deliver to your customer, the faster you get paid and the sooner you can reinvest.  The trick was to optimise the size of batches so that there was less working capital required in the system.  Less Work In Progress.

This became known as Lean manufacturing.

In modern, high-growth companies, it's known that predictable growth leads to higher growth, because you can match your supply to demand.  You know where to focus and for how long.  So this exercise will help us understand both predicability and batch sizes.

## Preparation 

You will need a Flip-chart / whiteboard for recoding purposes. 
Important hereby is that coins and cards have different sides. 

Split the audience in groups of 4-5 people.
Try to make them sit on one side of a table in a linear seating arrangement. 
Natural obstacles such as space in between tables ( in order for cards not to be pushed along the table ) enhances the game experience. Make these consistent for all teams.
Take the coin/card - decks and split these into batches of 100 coins/cards depending on card /coin availability.  

## Running the game

1. Explain the background 
1. Explain the rules. 
1. Visually diagram what is the 'Ready-Area'  and what is 'Work-Area'.
1. Demonstrate ( interplay between 'ready - area'  and 'work - area' )
1. Explain the first round will be 100 cards in batches of 20.
1. Give each team a few minutes to discuss and predict how long it will take for (a) the first batch to be complete (b) for all batches to be complete
1. Run the simulation.  Record the actual results for each team.
1. Discuss the accurate and inaccurate predictions as a group.  
1. Change the batch size to 5.
1. Ask for predictions again.
1. Run the simulation and record the actual results.
1. Discuss.


## Rules
* All the players are instructed only to use the left hand
* You must handle cards one at a time
* When you are done with your batch in your work area, you place the whole batch in the next ready area
* If the ready area is full, you must wait until it is clear before you place your cards there.  
* You must clear your work area of your current batch before you start on the next batch.
* Important to call out 1st and last batch when 'shipped'. 

## How to play (Round 1.) : 

Ask teams to choose a fictional name and record these names in grid - format on flipchart / whiteboard. 
Player I. ( Player closest to card - deck / coin batch ) get the instructions to count of 20 cards/coins at the beginning of the game. These cards/coins are then lying in the space between him and the next player sitting next to him. Player II. pulls the cards from 'ready - area' to 'work -area' in front of him. 
Player II. flips the cards one by one, only using left hand. He then puts the batch of 20 cards in the 'ready area' for the next player to continue in the same manner. This interplay of pull and push ( alternating between players ) is continued until all 100 cards. 



## Round 1 discussion
* compare accuracy:
* Let's talk about what happened ?
* How did you get to estimation ?
* Many people working in comparison to little people working

### Typical lessons learned in round 1
* Errors are expensive since the whole batch has to be sent back. If one thing in the assembly - line process goes wrong it ripples.
* It's easy to get caught up in measuring the work of one person and adding or multiplying for the whole team, but this doesn't see how much of the whole team is working at a point.
 
### Typical lessons learned in round 2
* Smaller batches are easier to do individually. It's easier to work and spot problems as they happen.
* It's much much faster at getting the first batch through, which means we're getting money AND customer feedback much sooner.

Smaller batches means:

* Faster market insights 
* Lower error rate 
* Faster learning
* Steady growth, matching demand - predicatability curve. 
 
## Conclusion:
Working in smaller batches is more capital efficient.  It means you grow faster, just like compound interest compounding more frequently.

Systems thinking is about stepping back and optimising for the whole system, not one part of it.  In business, this is like when your sales people sell more, but bring in customers who are difficult to support.

As you grow, you want to get good at predicting your capacity as a whole system, matching all the parts, so that your working capital is used as efficiently as possible.
