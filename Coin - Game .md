## Coin - Game 
### Writeup
	
	
Coin - game is a game which simulates / demonstrates 'Lean-Manufacturing Process' such as popularized by Toyota. 

After the WW II. , Toyata incorporated a new workflow / work style which meant that in terms of production it could compete with larger manufacturers.  The manufacturing style was build around predictability and manufacturing in smaller rather than larger batches. Here by keeping the whole manufacturing belt in motion throughout the progress .

** Preparation **

Split the audience in groups of 5 - 8 people for LIF Batch I. ( 7 groups of 6 ). 
Try to make them sit on one side of a table in a linear seating arrangement. 
Take the coin/card - decks and split these into batches of 80 or 100 coins/cards depending on card /coin availability.  Important hereby is that coins and cards have different sides. 
Start of with explaining the rules. 

You will need a Flip-chart / whiteboard for recoding purposes. 

** Rules ** 

* All the players are instructed only to use the left hand
* If playing with cards, the usage of natural obstacles such as space in between tables ( in order for cards not to be pushed along the table ) enhances the game experience. 
* Determine what is 'Ready-Area'  and what is 'Work-Area'.

* Remember to repeat all rules before the game starts * 
* Demonstrate push and pull ( interplay between 'ready - area'  and 'work - area' *


How to play (Round 1.) : 

Ask teams to choose a fictional name and record these names in grid - format on flipchart / whiteboard. 
Player I. ( Player closest to card - deck / coin batch ) get the instructions to count of 20 cards/coins at the beginning of the game. These cards/coins are then lying in the space between him and the next player sitting next to him. Player II. pulls the cards from 'ready - area' to 'work -area' in front of him. 
Player II. flips the cards one by one, only using left hand. He then puts the batch of 20 cards in the 'ready area' for the next player to continue in the same manner. This interplay of pull and push ( alternating between players ) is continued until all 100 cards. 


Lefthand only
Batches of 20

Ask for estimations! 
How much time will it take to complete 1. Batch /  ALL  Batches

Important to call out 1st Batch when 'shiped'. 


At the end of Round 1. :

=> compare accuracy:
=> Let's talk about what happened ?
=> How did you get to estimation ?
=> Many people working in comparison to little people working

Steady growth, matching demand - predicatability curve. 
* If one thing in the assembly - line process goes wrong it ripples.
How to play (Round 2.) : 

Batches of 5 

Ask for estimations
Goal / Leanring:

Smaller batches means:

* Faster market insights 
* Lower error rate 
* Faster learning

==>  You have to get good at PREDICTABILITY
		==>  Manage everything accordingly
