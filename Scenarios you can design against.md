# Scenarios you can design against
There are two ways to deal with scenario's during a workshop. 

One way is to anticipate for scenario's happening, and design against them by applying facilitation techniques in your preparation. Examples of this are using a Question Map to get a better sense of knowledge differences within the group, or jointly defining the rules of behavior for the workshop with participants.

The second way is to react on the spot by applying a certain technique. 

In this facilitation manual you will find that all the techniques will be labeled as either, so that you know when you can start applying them: either in prepration or during the workshop.
