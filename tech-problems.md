#Tech Problems - workshop

** Your running on a tight schedule for a client, come into a fixed setting and run into exceptional tech-problems **


* take charge and buy yourself time - communicate to the group 'get coffee', 'read e-mails', 'give me 20 min' 
* Run your deck without slides -  make a rough agenda with key goals / objectives you want to hammer home and use that as baseline orientation 

A basic, professional level of prep can avoid a lot of problems:
* Always be prepared by having 'pens and sticky notes'. Also just having some relevant worksheets with you is a good back-up.
* Call someone out of the organising team to fix your tech - problem whilst you engage with the group ( post -up , conversation, intro , ice -breaker game ) etc - ( no need of tech )
* Be prepared always - workshop -kit ( connector, clicker, hdmi etc. ). Always check your kit before you leave home.
* take charge - communicate to the group to 'get coffee', 'read e-mails', 'give me 20 min' 
* Run your deck without slides -  make a rough agenda with key goals / objectives you want to hammer home and use that as baseline orientation. Good support for this is always asking the organising committee for a flipchart to be ready at the venue
