<p>One way is to anticipate for scenario&#39;s happening, and design against them by applying facilitation techniques in your preparation. Examples of this are planning in a Question Map to be able to anticipate knowledge differences within the group, or carving out time to jointly define the rules of behavior for the workshop with participants.</p>
<p>The second way relates to scenario&#39;s that can&#39;t be tackled by design of the workshop. For instance dealing with a room full of jerks, or someone puking over their next seat neighbour because of their hangover from a good night out in London.You will need to react on the spot by applying a certain technique to deal with that.</p>
<p>In this facilitation manual you will find that all the techniques will be labeled as either, so that you know when you can start applying them: either in prepration or during the workshop.</p></body></html>
