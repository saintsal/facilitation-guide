# Huddles
A technique which is essential to facilitators in communicating information to the teacher. 

Important: Facilitator calls for the huddle 

Information which can be passed on is:

* Energy
* Atmosphere
* Information on audience
* Changes in workshop progress
* Time
* Any other issues

How to stage a huddle:

Open Huddles: Facilitator calls for a huddle in-front of the audience and to discuss/mention something briefly
Outside Huddles / Break: Longer huddle whilst participants are at a break / or engaged with an exercise - ideal to communicate a course change and a good check - in for teacher ( feedback and information on audience )
