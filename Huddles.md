# Huddles
A technique which is essential to facilitators in communicating information to the teacher. 

Anyone on the team can call a huddle with eye contact and hand gesture, or verbally.

Huddles are useful when you need to have a quick but private conversation, to make a decision together or to communicate something in more detail than you can during performances.

Information which can be passed on is:

* Energy
* Atmosphere
* Information on audience
* Changes in workshop progress
* Time
* Any other issues

Common uses:

* rectifying miscommunication between facilitator and teacher
* plan changes
* syncing on a plan to deal with difficult participants

How to stage a huddle:

Open Huddles: Facilitator calls for a huddle in-front of the audience and to discuss/mention something briefly

Outside Huddles / Break: Longer huddle whilst participants are at a break / or engaged with an exercise - ideal to communicate a course change and a good check - in for teacher ( feedback and information on audience )
