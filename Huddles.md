# Huddles
A technique which is essential to facilitators in communicating information to the teacher. 

Anyone on the team can call a huddle with eye contact and hand gesture, or verbally.

Then, you'll all leave the room (or ear-shot) for a private conversation.

Huddles are useful when you need to have a quick but private conversation, to make a decision together or to communicate something in more detail than you can during performances.

The best moment to call for a huddle is when you sense misalignment of the content with the group, or if you don't know how to practically tackle a certain situation. There are two things you can do to free-up a moment for the huddle. You can either get people on an exercise for a couple of minutes, or you can weld in a break if it's been a while since you've had one (say more than 20 minutes ago).

Information which can be passed on is:

* Energy
* Atmosphere
* Information on audience
* Changes in workshop progress
* Time
* Any other issues

Common uses:

* rectifying miscommunication between facilitator and teacher
* plan changes
* syncing on a plan to deal with difficult participants

How to stage a huddle:

The default way is a big finger-loop hand gesture.  Make sure you're making eye contact so the other person receives the message.  A nod is enough to confirm.

You might want to call for a huddle verbally.  It's okay for the participants to know a huddle is going to happen. "Let's huddle for 2 minutes."
