<p>Physical comfort goes a long way.  It&#39;s really a pre-requisite for a functional learning environment.  If this doesn&#39;t exist, address this first. Don&#39;t fool yourself into thinking you can &quot;push through.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Take Charge - pull in staff, students, etc. to fix what you can before you start.</li>
<li>Buy time if you need to</li>
<li>If it&#39;s hard to focus, change the plan to include more breaks, and less content.  This way you&#39;re optimising for overall knowledge retention and experience.</li>
<li>Try to find an alternative location outside or close-by without lots of commotion and distraction (maybe task a staff member with this)</li>
<li>introduce more standing rather than sitting if it&#39;s a hot or low energy room</li>
<li>small group and individual exercises are better when there&#39;s a lot of background noise</li>
<li>Ask for group - members to &#39;drink -lots&#39; </li>
</ul>
<p>A basic, professional level of prep can avoid a lot of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always be prepared by having &#39;pens and sticky notes&#39;. Also just having some relevant worksheets with you is a good back-up  - helps in making anything into a Venue ( Bar, Restaurant etc. )</li>
<li>Call someone out of the organising team to fix your venue problem; Buy lunch or drinks at any given place. Deal with delivery first, and figure out the economics of what you&#39;re doing at a later point (unless you find yourself buying a Bentley for some weird reason)</li>
