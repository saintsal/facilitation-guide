<p><strong> Your running on a tight schedule for a client, come into a fixed setting and run into exceptional tech-problems </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>take charge and buy yourself time - communicate to the group &#39;get coffee&#39;, &#39;read e-mails&#39;, &#39;give me 20 min&#39; </li>
<li>Run your deck without slides -  make a rough agenda with key goals / objectives you want to hammer home and use that as baseline orientation </li>
</ul>
<p>A basic, professional level of prep can avoid a lot of problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always be prepared by having &#39;pens and sticky notes&#39;. Also just having some relevant worksheets with you is a good back-up.</li>
<li>Call someone out of the organising team to fix your tech - problem whilst you engage with the group ( post -up , conversation, intro , ice -breaker game ) etc - ( no need of tech )</li>
<li>Be prepared always - workshop -kit ( connector, clicker, hdmi etc. ). Always check your kit before you leave home.</li>
<li>take charge - communicate to the group to &#39;get coffee&#39;, &#39;read e-mails&#39;, &#39;give me 20 min&#39; </li>
<li>Run your deck without slides -  make a rough agenda with key goals / objectives you want to hammer home and use that as baseline orientation. Good support for this is always asking the organising committee for a flipchart to be ready at the venue</li>
