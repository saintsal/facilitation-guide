There are various reasons why a facilitator would want to speed up a workshop. </p>
<p>*It could be that the audience is already familiar with certain parts of the content, which means you can shift to more advanced topics, and increase the pace of delivery.</p>
<p>*It could be that the group is energetic, and is catching on to the content quickly, meaning you can cover more ground.</p>
<p>*It could be that a certain part of beginning of the workshop got stuck, and limits time for the remaining parts ( Time constraints generally ).</p>
<p>The facilitator&#39;s job is to sense when to speed up, and make the call suggesting how to speed things up. The teacher doesn&#39;t need to think that through, and debate whether acceleration is necessary.</p>
<p>Suggestions for acceleration would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>huddles - communicate a new plan / course of action towards the remaining time of the workshop </li>
<li>stage open conversation &quot;let&#39;s move on to the next point&quot;, &quot;let&#39;s skip XYZ&quot;, &quot;let&#39;s round off with?&quot;</li>
<li>prepare/interplay; pre - agree on hand-signs </li>
</ul></body></html>
