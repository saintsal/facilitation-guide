<p>Anyone on the team can call a huddle with eye contact and hand gesture, or verbally.</p>
<p>Then, you&#39;ll all leave the room (or ear-shot) for a private conversation.</p>

<p>The best moment to call for a huddle is when you sense misalignment of the content with the group, or if you don&#39;t know how to practically tackle a certain situation. </p>
<p>There are two things you can do to free-up a moment for the huddle. You can either get people on an exercise for a couple of minutes, or you can weld in a break if it&#39;s been a while since you&#39;ve had one (say more than 20 minutes ago).</p>
<p>The rule is that the person who signals the huddle will need to facilitate the movement that frees up that time.</p>
<p>##How to stage a huddle</p>
<p>The default way is a big finger-loop hand gesture.  Make sure you&#39;re making eye contact so the other person receives the message.  A nod is enough to confirm.</p>
<p>You might want to call for a huddle verbally.  It&#39;s okay for the participants to know a huddle is going to happen. &quot;Let&#39;s huddle for 2 minutes.&quot;</p></body></html>
