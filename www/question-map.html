<p><strong>why</strong>: to better understand your audience, and to source concrete ideas for calibrating [link to calibration] content to your audience&#39;s demand on the spot.</p>
<p><strong>when</strong>: at the beginning of a workshop or programme.</p>

<p>How to ( Step by Step )</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the participants aware that the purpose is to explain learning goals to eachother. </li>
<li>Ask people to think of what they want to learn today/this week/over the programme.</li>
<li>Ask them to think about their current challenges and what they can apply, to make their requests actionable.</li>
<li>Ask them to write down one question or request per sticky note.</li>
<li>When they have a sticky note, ask them to come to front of the room and explain their request <em>to everyone.</em> Otherwise it gets boring, and a seemingly private conversation, which makes it hard to engage the room.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s important that they share one point at a time and to the room.
Keep it fast and punchy, and keep it to short conversations or clarifying questions.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t start analysing immediately after the post-up. Leave that for the break, and decide then whether you&#39;re on track, or not.</p></body></html>
