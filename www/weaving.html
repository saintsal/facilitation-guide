<p>There&#39;s one beginning, a body, and a conclusion.
Things become harder to follow when multiple topics are treated in sequence.  For example, by combining business models, and customer development in a session that lasts an afternoon. </p>
<p>People tend to naturally understand the topics separately, but grasping the whole of the sequence is harder.  For example, how do customers conversations translate into business model changes?</p>
<p>This is particularly the case if your program runs over multiple days.</p>
<p>Weaving is what you do to make people see the links. You&#39;re addressing their assumptions of how the topics fit together.</p>
<p>It&#39;s more than emphasizing the learning points, it&#39;s about showing how the points connect.</p></body></html>
