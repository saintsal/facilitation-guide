<p><strong> Your running on a tight schedule for a client, come into a fixed setting and run into exceptional tech-problems </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Call someone out and ask to fix your tech - problem whilst you engage with the group ( post -up , conversation, intro , ice -breaker game ) etc - ( no need of tech )</li>
<li>Be prepared always - ( connector, clicker etc. )</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> The room is unbearable; heat, noise, not spacious </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More breaks - less content </li>
<li>Try to find an alternative location outside or close - by without starring lots of comossion </li>
<li>Excercises should be conducted in standing rather than sitting</li>
<li>Ask for group - members to &#39;drink -lots&#39; </li>
</ul>
<p><strong> Postnotes are raining </strong></p>
<p><strong> Missing crucial material halfway through the game </strong></p>
<p>Other situations if forgotten:</p>
<p><em>Technical Device Distraction - Several members of the group are constantly on Laptop throughout the workshop session / They are distracting their peers and are not 100% engaged with the group</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>Call them out ( ideally at the beginning of the session ) - be open about your content needing full attention and that you understand if he needs to go out to respond to important mail / call</li>
<li>Invite him to come back to the room at any given time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> If there are different levels of knowledge within the group ( example BMC ) </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Request person with advanced knwoledge to share his experience with the group or help his peers</li>
<li>Ask him to sit out /  take a break for the time being</li>
</ul></body></html>
