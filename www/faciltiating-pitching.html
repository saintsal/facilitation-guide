<p>Getting participants to stand up and pitch, is always a risk to the flow of your workshop. Common ways of that happening is stories that beat about the bush, or never ending stories brought in great detail. Pitching doesn&#39;t come natural to most people. Thery&#39;re there to learn, right?</p>
<p>Ensuring that pitching moments remain engaging is hard, paticularly in larger groups. </p>
<p>The following techniques will help you to deal with driving engagement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time box the pitch to 90 seconds</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Questions you might ask yourself: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Are slides worth using -  bare in mind the technical hassle of collecting presentations and / or setting every participants laptop up - ( Yes / No ) ?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How long is the attention span - when is it necessary to set breaks ?</p>
</li>
<li>Is it worth splitting the group to cut out more focus ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Different Pitching Formats  -  ( benefits / ideas ) :</p>
<ul>
<li>Pecha Kucha: great way to keep audience visually engaged ( 20 sec. / slide fixed ) </li>
<li>Storyboard: Let participants draw / sketch their pitches on 6 - 8 slides/grid/boxes  ( Storyboard style ) - &#39;investors&#39; walk into the room and look at each &#39;storyboard - pitch&#39;  and engage if their are questions =&gt; in this way everyone stays engaged/busy </li>
</ul>
<p>Other suggestions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Carve out frequent and long breaks </li>
<li>Don&#39;t give feedback on the spot - but reserve for later - will keep the energy up</li>
<li>Involve audience by giving them tasks to do: Rate, Give Feedback to each participant, Accelerator Dashboard, Grid, Put them in the position on investor</li>
<li>Split groups ( sent one group off with one facilitator or sent one group for lunch/ coffee )</li>
