<ol>
<li>Bordome</li>
<li>&#39;They think they know this already&#39;</li>
<li>Prove themselves to the group </li>
<li>Forced to be there </li>
<li>They simply disagree </li>
<li><p>&#39;They just are in the wrong workshop&#39;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Involve him in processes, games and experiments to a greater extent</p>
</li>
<li>Give them the stage - include them especially on a given topic ( make sure this is something you can hand - off )</li>
<li>Try to find what his problem is ( during break ) - try to establish a conversation early on</li>
<li>Special cases - &#39;unbearable&#39; - ask him kindly to leave in order to uphold the quality of teaching for his peers</li>
<li>&#39;Yes And&#39; - don&#39;t fight - confront but don&#39;t get in an open conflict</li>
<li>Use your personal experience as credibility ( Establish credibility in &#39;Partnerships&#39; ) / Don&#39;t antagonise  </li>
