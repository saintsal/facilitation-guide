# Venue Problems

** The room is unbearable; heat, noise, not spacious ( Jackhammer/Sauna / Power failure ) **

* More breaks - less content 
* Try to find an alternative location outside or close - by without starring lots of commotion 
* Exercises should be conducted in standing rather than sitting
* Ask for group - members to 'drink -lots' 
* Take Charge 

A basic, professional level of prep can avoid a lot of problems:

* Always be prepared by having 'pens and sticky notes'. Also just having some relevant worksheets with you is a good back-up  - helps in making anything into a Venue ( Bar, Restaurant etc. )
* Call someone out of the organising team to fix your venue problem; Buy lunch or drinks at any given place
