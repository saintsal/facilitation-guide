#Pace
Flow in a workshop depends on pacing the content, as much as it does on quality of that content.
An engaging teacher, who takes too long, or goes off at a tangent too often, will likely miss achieving outcomes and learning goals of participants.
The facilitator is in a key position to influence the pace of delivery for the teacher and must wield that influence at appropriate times
